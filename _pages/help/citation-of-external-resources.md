#  Citation of external resources

How Pleiades considers and models citation of external resources

Up to now, Pleiades has allowed citation of external resources in a very
limited way. This document describes the next step toward richer and more
useful citations.

### Citations from Places

A Pleiades _Place_ object has as its primary topic some entity of the ancient
world. Other resources also describe the same ancient place and we're going to
use citations of _see also_ and _see further_ type to link to those resources.

_See also_ and _see further_ are equivalent to
[cito:citesAsRelated](http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsRelated) and
[cito:citesForInformation](http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesForInformation) from
CiTO, the Citation Ontology, respectively. All of the references that Pleiades
has brought from the Barrington Atlas are of type _see further_.

### Citations from Locations and Names

Pleiades _Location_ and _Name_ objects embody a number of assertions. To back
them up we aim to _cite_ arguments in books and articles and features on maps,
and _cite as evidence_ factual resources like a recording of an object bearing
a name or a site survey. The external resources shown below are illustrative,
not exhaustive.

locations-and-names/image_large)

_Cites_ and _cites as evidence_ are taken directly from CiTO.
