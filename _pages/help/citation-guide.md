#  Citation Guide

Examples of how to cite books, articles, and websites in the "references"
sections of Pleiades place, name, and location resources (including commonly
used abbreviations and short titles).

Contents

## Commonly Cited Resources

You can learn more about the mechanics of entering references in [How to add a
new reference (link, article, book) to an existing place resource](add-new-
reference "How to add a new reference \(link, article, book\) to an existing
place resource" ). For more information on how we use references, and on how
to choose the "reference type" when entering them, please consult [Citation of
external resources](citation-of-external-resources "Citation of external
resources" ).

For commonly cited resources, we generally prefer an abbreviation or short
title, followed by a comma and then the title of the article or entry in the
cited work, but you will note some variations in this approach for specific
works below. When citing works originally published in print, we always try to
provide a link to an online version if available. Older content in Pleiades
(i.e., that which predates publication of this guide) or that which has been
imported from other datasets may exhibit other variations in citation
practice.

**Note: **For common works related to the Greek and Roman classics not mentioned in this guide, please follow the abbreviation conventions of the _Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World_ or, failing thatþ, the _Oxford Classical Dictionary_.

**Brill's New Pauly (English version)**

Use the link provided by Brill Online in the "citation" block, not necessarily
the link in your browser location window.

* **Reference Identifier:** http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/naarda-e815560
* **Specific Citation:** New Pauly, Naarda

(see also "Der Neue Pauly" herein)

**Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL)**

* (to be added)

**Epigraphic Database Roma (EDR)**

* (to be added)

**Epigraphische Datenbank Heidelberg (EDH)**

* **Reference Identifier: **http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/edh/inschrift/HD007455
* **Specific Citation: **EDH HD007455

**Geonames.org**

Use the link labeled by Geonames as "permalink", rather than a search result
or other page.

* **Reference Identifier: **http://www.geonames.org/312495/hasan-dagi.html
* **Specific Citation:** geonames:312495

NB: when copying coordinates from Geonames directly into a new Pleiades
_location_, the reference type should be set to "Cites as data source" and a
string like the following example should be added to the "initial provenance"
field on the location:

* GeoNames GeoNameId: 312495

**Inscriptiones Graecae**

We cite IG after the model of the [PHI Greek
Inscriptions](http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/) project (e.g., IG
IV²,1 95). Pleiades reference fields do not permit superscript, therefore
where the convention is to use superscript (e.g., to represent edition
number), we prefix with a caret (^; e.g., IG IV^2,1 95). Line numbers and
ranges for same can be appended after a full stop (period). **
**

* **Reference Identifier: **IG IV^2,1 95.34

Note that, whenever possible, we should also add a corresponding link to the
PHI entry for such an inscription (see below).

**Livius.org**

* **Reference Identifier: **http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/faqra/faqra.html
* **Specific Citation:** Livius.org, Faqra

**Der Neue Pauly (German version)**

Use the link provided by Brill Online in the "citation" block, not necessarily
the link in your browser location window).

* **Reference Identifier: **http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/der-neue-pauly/hadrianopolis-e501190
* **Specific Citation:** NPauly, Hadrianopolis

(see also "Brill's New Pauly" herein)

**OpenStreetMap (OSM)**

* **Reference Identifier: **http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/633024977
* **Specific Citation:** osm:node=633024977

**The Peutinger Map (the so-called "Tabula Peutingeriana")**

The Peutinger Map is an ancient work (a "primary source"). Unlike many ancient
literary texts, it does not have a long-standing canonical system of citation
developed by humanist scholars. We prefer citations to the TP to be
constructed using the grid reference system developed by Richard Talbert for
his book Rome's World, as exemplified below. Such citations are to be
accompanied by links to Talbert's digital edition (aka "database"), which is
published online by Cambridge University Press.

* **Reference Identifier: **http://www.cambridge.org/us/talbert/talbertdatabase/TPPlace997.html
* **Specific Citation:** TP 2A5 Ad Renvm (Talbert 997)

> (see further: [How does one cite the Tabula Peutingeriana?](tpeut "How does
one cite the Tabula Peutingeriana?" ))

**PHI Greek Inscriptions**

When citing an inscription that is also included in _Searchable Greek
Inscriptions: A Scholarly Tool in Progress._ Packard Humanities Institute.
<http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/>, you should add a reference for
the PHI entry using the PHI ID-based permalink for the inscription, as
follows:

* **Reference Identifier: **http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=265198
* **Specific Citation:** PHI 265198

The PHI number can be found near the lower right-hand corner of any
inscription page on the PHI site. You can (and should) omit query terms
trailing the inscription key number in the PHI "permalinks" (lower right-hand
corner of a PHI page; e.g., &bookid=7&region=2&subregion=2).

When citing an inscription in a print corpus, e.g., IG, the PHI citation can
be combined, thus:

* **Reference Identifier: **http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=28524
* **Specific Citation:** PHI 28524 = IG IV^2,1 95.34

**Pliny the Elder's Natural History**

When possible, cite Mayhoff's edition and link to the online copy at Perseus
or the Packard Humanities Institute.

* **Reference Identifier: **http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D13
* **Specific Citation:** Plin. NH (Mayhoff: Perseus), 3.13

or

* **Reference Identifier: **http://latin.packhum.org/loc/978/1/353/40-47#353
* **Specific Citation:** Plin. NH (Mayhoff: PHI), 5.88.1

**Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites**

When possible, cite the online, digitized version at Perseus, using the full
title for the site entry.

* **Reference Identifier: **http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0006%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D1%3Aentry%3Dabodiacum
* **Specific Citation:** PECS (Perseus), ABODIACUM (Epfach) Upper Bavaria, Germany

**Ptolemy's Geography**

There have been a number of editions of Ptolemy published over the years. Some
have treated the whole work, others only parts. Therefore all citations of
Ptolemy in Pleiades need to be glossed with the edition used. Pleiades
contributors are encouraged to use the preferred citation method (below), but
the editors realize that many will not have access to that particular edition.
Therefore, we provide guidance on citing all relevant editions. Some editions
are described here because they were used in data previously imported into
Pleiades from the Barrington Atlas.

The editors' preference is for citations of Alfred Stückelberger & Gerd
Grasshof (2006) Ptolemaois: Handbuch der Geographie. 2 Volumes. Schwabe (not
available online) in the following format:

* **Specific Citation:** Ptol. (Stückelberger), X.X

The following other editions may be cited when appropriate (e.g., when the
user does not have access to Stückelberger).

_C. Müller, 2 vols. + maps, Paris, 1883-1901 (used by BAtlas in citing Ptolemy
Books 1-5)_

* **Reference Identifier: **http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49801572
* **Specific Citation:** Ptol. (Müller), X.X

_C.F.A. Nobbe, Leipzig, 1833-45 (used by BAtlas in citing Ptolemy Books 6-8,
except 6.1-6.21)_

* Ptol. (Nobbe), X.X

digital copy online at the Packard Humanities Institute.

* **Reference Identifier: **http://latin.packhum.org/loc/2331/26/27/48-59#27
* **Specific Citation:** SHA Aurel (Hohl: PHI), 26.1.1

**Smith's Geography**

Although long-superseded for many of its entries by more recent scholarly
publications, William Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854)
remains an admirable and useful reference work, providing information about
attested names and their sources. Its value is significantly enhanced by its
digitization and online publication in the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts
University. For all these reasons, citations of Smith's Geography are welcome
in Pleiades after the following model:

* **Reference Identifier: **http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DT%3Aentry+group%3D16%3Aentry%3Dturris-libyssonis-geo
* **Specific Citation:** Smith 1854 (Perseus), TURRIS LIBYSSONIS

**Stephanus of Byzantium**

When possible, cite Meineke's edition and include a link to the appropriate
page of the digitized copy in Google Books.
