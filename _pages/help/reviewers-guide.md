#  Reviewers' Guide

The basic things a Pleiades reviewer or editor should check before publishing
or checking in changed/new content.

### Does the suggestion appear to be complicated, problematic, or otherwise
"soupy?"

For example, does it involve contested _Name_ associations? If so, surface the
suggestion to the rest of the college of editors and reviewers along with a
one-to-two sentence summary of the argument or problem. Go ahead and check the
following issues first, as applicable.

### If a new or updated _Place_ is provided...

1. Avoid use of abbreviations and Latin feature type strings in _Titles_. E.g., expand "M." to "Mons"; replace "fl." with " River".
2. Will the _Description_ be helpful in identifying the place and disambiguating it from other similarly named places when encountered in a search result list, landing-page map, or third-party website?
3. Is the _Place Type_ (a.k.a. Place Category) accurate?
4. If _Connections_ are indicated, do they make sense? See ["What are 'connections?'"](what-are-connections "What are "connections?"" ) for more guidance.

### If a new or updated _Location_ is provided...

1. Does the suggestion make sense on the map and in Google Earth?
2. We prefer _Locations_ of archaeological remains visible in publicly available satellite imagery. So "location of the Roman theatre" or "location of Trajan's Arch" are good candidates for _Locations_. A center point of the modern village, ancient site or visible archaeological remains should be used only as a fallback option when something more specific and identifiable cannot be used.
3. _Titles_ should be appropriately descriptive and avoid including punctuation (see examples in previous bullet).
4. Ideally, all _Locations_ have at least one _Reference_ with a _Citation Type_ = "cites" indicating a source used to help find or identify the Location (i.e., "this Pleiades _Location_ cites XYZ"). If coordinates were sourced directly from Wikipedia or GeoNames, then such a reference must be included. When _Locations_ are sourced from, or follow other resources, a short statement to this effect should be included in the _Description_.
5. An appropriate _Positional Accuracy Assessment_ is required.
6. If _Location_ is for the remains of a built structure, one or more _Temporal Attestations_ for the period of active use must be provided. _Locations_ of long-lasting physical features (e.g., mountain peaks) do not require dates.

### If a new or updated _Name_ is provided...

1. _Name as Attested_ is highly desired, but not required. If such an "attested form" is provided, it must be transcribed from a historical source or based on reasoned argument (if witnesses are thought to be corrupt or fragmentary). The _Name as Attested_ must be in the correct Unicode script.
2. If the _Name_ is historical/ancient, or if not common knowledge online, then a _Reference_ with _Citation Type_ = "Cites as Evidence" or "Cites" must be provided. The former value indicates the name is transcribed from the historical source indicated in the Reference. The latter value indicates that the modern literature cited in the _Reference_ provides interpretation or argument regarding the form and interpretation of the name.
3. Are language and script designations correct?
4. Only basic Roman characters (a-z, A-Z) and common accents for transliteration/Romanization schemes are allowed in _Romanized Name(s)_ field. Multiple transliterations/Romanizations are permitted; these must be separated by commas. We prefer that a transliteration/Romanization without accents be the first in the list.
5. At least one appropriate _Temporal Attestation_ must be provided; these should at the very least match the period of composition or coverage of any ancient or historical sources cited (or "Modern" in the case of a current, modern name).

### General issues

1. All _References_ must conform to the [Citation Guide](citation-guide "Citation Guide" ) and employ the correct_ Citation Type_ (see [Citation of External Resources](citation-of-external-resources "Citation of external resources" ) for guidance).
