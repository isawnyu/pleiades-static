#  Why can't I find my favorite ancient site?

The two most likely explanations are: a) we don't have it, or b) search
failure.

It could be that the ancient place uncovered at your favorite site (or
mentioned in your favorite text) hasn't made it into _Pleiades_ yet. If you'd
like to help us expand and improve our content, please consider [joining the
_Pleiades_ community](../welcome "Welcome to Pleiades" ). You'll get a userid
and password and you'll be able to submit new content for review and
publication (with full credit, of course).

Our primary search field is a combination of resource title, description,
modern name or location, and text. A search on "Ankara" will turn up
[http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/619103](../places/619103/) (Ancyra) because
the modern name information is included in the Place entry. Many _Pleiades_
places have not yet had all ancient name variants in all languages added,
therefore you might want to try a few alternatives if you don't succeed with
your first try. Note that a search for "Corinth" via
[http://pleiades.stoa.org/search_form](../search_form) looks for exactly that
string surrounded by non-word characters and returns two places in the
neighborhood of modern Corinth. A search for "Corinth*" will yield
[http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/570182](../places/570182), ancient Corinthus.
Note that the _Pleiades_ site's "live search" feature effectively adds the *
wildcard to your query, broadening your searches.

For more information on searching _Pleiades_, please see: "[How to Search for
Things in _Pleiades_.](how-to-search "How to search for things in Pleiades" )"
