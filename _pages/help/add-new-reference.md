#  How to add a new reference (link, article, book) to an existing place
resource

1. Login to the site.
2. Navigate to the existing place resource.
3. Select "Actions" -> "Check Out".
4. In the newly created working copy, select the "edit" tab.
5. A set of subordinate tabs appears; select the "References" tab.
6. Click on the plus sign (+) below the last "Reference identifier and citation pair" (you may have to scroll down).
7. If you have a link for the book, article or web page in question, enter it in the "Reference Identifier" text box.
8. Enter a human-readable citation in the "Specific Citation" box. [See our Citation Guide for short-form citations for many common reference works and websites](citation-guide "Citation Guide" ) (and a how-to for longer citations). You need not enter a link for a digital resource if you have included it in the "Reference Identifier" box.
9. Enter a short explanatory note (e.g., added reference to Smith 2014) in the "change note" text box.
10. Click the "save" button at the bottom of the edit page.
11. Once the page reloads, click "State: Drafting" to reveal a pull-down menu. From that menu, select "Advanced".
12. On the "publishing process" page, put a check-mark in the "Include contained items" check box, then enter any desired comments in the "comments" text box.
13. Scroll to the bottom of the "publishing process" page, select the "Submit for review" radio button and click the "save" button. Your submission will be routed to the Pleiades editorial board for review.
