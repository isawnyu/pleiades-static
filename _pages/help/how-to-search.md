#  How to search for things in Pleiades

Learn how to find a place by its ancient or modern name, and in other ways.

Note: if none of the following techniques helps you find what you're looking
for, please have a look at the our other search help documents.

### Live Search on most Pleiades pages

![Screen Capture of Live Search in
Action](images/quicksearch.jpg/image_preview)Most Pleiades pages have a
"Search" box near the top of the right-hand column that can be used to search
any of the text contained in our Places, Names, and Locations (including UTF-8
encoded strings in scripts other than English). This "Live Search" tool tries
to match results as you type. It draws upon a text index that incorporates the
title, description, details, references, and attested names of Pleiades
objects.

To use it, start typing the text of interest into the "Search Site" text box.
A pop-up list of search results will appear if, after 3 or 4 characters are
entered, there are any matches. If your place of interest appears, click on it
to go directly to the associated resource. Otherwise press the "Enter" key on
your keyboard to go to a search results page from which you can choose your
specific choice.

Note that common names (like Alexandria) may result in more hits than the Live
Search pop-up can show. When this happens, you'll be given a "Show All..."
option.

**Advanced Search**

Immediately below the Live Search box, you'll find a link to "Advanced
Search...". The [Advanced Search page](../search_form) lets you configure many
aspects of your search. Instructions can be found in the associated help
document: [Using Advanced Search](using-advanced-search "Using Advanced
Search" ).
