#  Is Pleiades like Google Maps or Google Earth?

Pleiades is more like "Google Places". We'd like our [Pont
Julien](../places/149500/), for example, to be the foremost resource on the
web for that ancient place. A big difference is that Pleiades places are
designed to be research and reference information hubs, not commercial
information hubs.
