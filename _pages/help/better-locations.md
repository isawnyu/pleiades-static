#  How do I add a better location for an existing place resource?

It's easy.

**Update:** it's now possible to add content quickly and easily from OpenStreetMap. See: [Linking Pleiades to OpenStreetMap](linking-pleiades-to-openstreetmap).

Just use the following steps:

* Login (if you don't have an account, you should [request one](../welcome "Welcome to Pleiades" ))
* Navigate to the place of interest
* Click the "Add location" button
* Fill out the form
* Click "Save"
* Select "State:drafting" and change to "Submit for review"

In filling out the form, try to make sure at least the following items are
complete:

* On the "Default" tab:
* Title
* Description
* Association certainty
* Temporal attestation
* On the "Coordinates" tab:
* Geometry (NB: in our notation, longitudes comes before latitudes ... that's the opposite of Google Earth!)
* Positional Accuracy Assessment
* If you've copied the coordinates from another source, you must cite it on the "References" tab

We've posted [a short, how-to video about adding a new Pleiades location on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srcTauAWMnc).
