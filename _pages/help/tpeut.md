#  How does one cite the Tabula Peutingeriana?

The so-called "Peutinger Map" is a primary source for a number of names and
variants, and there is now an excellent online edition (Talbert) that can be
cited.

If you wish to cite the Peutinger Map as a witness to a particular name
variant, please follow these procedures:

1. Find the appropriate variant in [Richard Talbert's TPeut features database](http://www.cambridge.org/us/talbert/talbertdatabase/prm.html) and copy the URI for the appropriate page (e.g., <http://www.cambridge.org/us/talbert/talbertdatabase/TPPlace997.html>). Note also the "Segment Grid" value (in this example, "2A5").
2. Add or check out and edit a Pleiades name resource.
3. Fill out the various fields appropriately.
4. Add a reference to the name resource ("References" tab). [See FAQ 21 for overall guidance on references](21).
5. In the "Reference identifier" field, paste in the Talbert URI.
6. In the "Specific citation" field, type a human-readable reference that incorporates both the "Segment Grid" value and the integer following the string "TPPlace" in the Talbert URI. So, for example: "TP 2A5 (Talbert 997)".
7. Set "Citation Type" to "Cites as evidence"
8. Click "Save"
9. Submit for review.
