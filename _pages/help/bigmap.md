#  Is there a big map I can see all the sites on?

Pleiades has a couple of internal options for maps with multiple places on
them. Some of our partners also provide other options.

Pleiades does have a "full map", but be forewarned: it's very rough. [Our
nightly exports](../downloads "Data for download" ) include a dump in KML
format that will overlay Pleiades locations over the globe in Google Earth
(and other applications). There's very little cartography employed in this KML
"map", but it's internet accessible and filled with direct links to Pleiades
resources. Every collection in
[http://pleiades.stoa.org/collections](../collections) provides the same type
of KML map.

To use Pleiades data to make custom maps for classroom use, or for print or
digital publications, you can try using [the collections feature of
Pleiades](../docs/collecting-places) to gather points of relevance, or you can
try out the [Antiquity À-la-carte web
application](http://awmc.unc.edu/wordpress/alacarte/), which is run by our
partners at the [Ancient World Mapping Center at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill](../docs/using-our-data/ancient-world-mapping-center
"Ancient World Mapping Center" ) and which includes not only all published
Pleiades content, but also historical river and coastline data derived from
the _Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World._
