#  Do I need a Pleiades account to see published Pleiades content?

No. Anyone with a web browser and access to the internet can access all
published Pleiades content.

You can find the content you're looking for via our [search
form](../search_form) or by [browsing links via one of our starting
points](../places/). In addition, you can [download an export of
everything](../downloads/) to use in a spreadsheet or database or Geographic
Information System (GIS) as you like.

If you want to participate in the publication review process or if you want to
submit corrections, improvements or original content of your own, then you'll
need to [request an
account](http://www.atlantides.org/trac/pleiades/wiki/PleiadesCommunity).
