#  I've lost my username. How do I recover it?

You may need to send us an email. Here's what to check first and where to send
it.

Check your email for the original message you got from us when your account
was created. It should have the subject line "Welcome to Pleiades!" You'll
find your username in the first paragraph of that message. If you've lost that
email, please send a note to [pleiades.admin@nyu.edu](mailto:pleiades.admin@ny
u.edu?subject=lost%20Pleiades%20username) and we'll respond to your request as
soon as we can.
