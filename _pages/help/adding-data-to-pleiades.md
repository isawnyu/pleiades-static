#  Adding data to Pleiades

![writeable world icon](/images/icons/writeworld.jpg){: .pull-left }
Since Pleiades operates like an online journal for ancient geography and
associated data, the editors invite you to submit information about missing or
misidentified places, more accurate spatial coordinates, alternate names (both
historical and modern), bibliography, links to other websites, and more. Get
started contributing content here.

To participate in the creation, update, and expansion of Pleiades content, you
need to have an account on the system. [Our Welcome Page](../../welcome
"Welcome to Pleiades" ) provides comprehensive guidance on becoming a Pleiades
member.
