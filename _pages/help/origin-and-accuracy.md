#  How do I indicate origin and accuracy of new location coordinates?

If coordinates are sourced directly from another publication, this should be
clearly indicated by adding a reference on the "location" resource. To
indicate the horizontal accuracy (when known) or in cases where coordinates
have been derived through analysis of maps or spatial imagery, Pleiades uses a
special document called an "accuracy assessment".

There are already stock imagery assessment documents in the Pleiades system
that can be re-used when appropriate. When you determine coordinates through
analysis of imagery in Google Earth. Just search for "google" when trying to
link to an accuracy assessment and choose the one containing the most recent
year matching the imagery date you're using. There are also stock accuracy
assessments for [GeoNames](../features/metadata/generic-geonames-accuracy-
assessment), [OpenStreetMap](../features/metadata/generic-osm-accuracy-
assessment), [generic hand-held GPS](../features/metadata/generic-handheld-
gps) units (if you've collected the coordinates on-site yourself), and more.

To view a short video demonstrating how to add an existing imagery assessment
document to a location resource, see <http://youtu.be/g-H6Tn87hyc>.
