#  Precision and Accuracy in Geolocation

Information about the horizontal accuracy and precision of Pleiades location
content.

## Precision and accuracy in major datasets incorporated in Pleiades

### Precision of Barrington Atlas coordinates

Sources of error

* Base map precision: 1/50"
* Mylar registration: 1/50"
* Feature placement: 1/30"

Sum: 0.073333"

Precision is dependent on map scale, and the Barrington Atlas incorporated
maps at 4 different scales. Nominal precision for each scale is as follows:

* Maps at 1:250,000: 465m
* Maps at 1:500,000: 930m
* Maps at 1:1,000,000: 1860m
* Maps at 1:5,000,000: 9310m

### Precision of DARMC coordinates

(to be added)

### Discussion of precision and accuracy for coordinates added through the web

(to be added; e.g., locations verified in Google Earth)
