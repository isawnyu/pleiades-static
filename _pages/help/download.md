#  Download the Full Dataset

Get complete and regular shapshots of all Pleiades resources, available in
multiple formats including CSV, KML, and RDF.

We're committed to data portability, the concept that users should be able to
get out what they put in to data site (and more). Serializations of Pleiades
content into various formats are available for download.

Serializations of Pleiades content into various formats are available via [our
downloads page](../downloads "Data for download" ). Formats available include:
Comma-Separated Value (CSV) and Keyhole Markup Language (KML for Google
Earth), both directly usable in many Geographic Information System (GIS)
programs. Resource Description Framework (RDF) data is also available in both
Turtle and RDF+XML formats.

Note that, because of the graph-like nature of Pleiades, there is no
relational database underneath this system. Consequently, there can be no
complete, high fidelity export to formats like CSV and KML. We try to provide
the most useful data attributes for mapping purposes in these download
formats.
