#  How do I update my profile page on the site?

Just follow these simple steps after logging in.

[Log in to Pleiades](../login_form). Click on your name in the upper right
portion of the page. Then click on the "profile" link. On the profile page,
click "edit." Make your modifications (including uploading a picture of
yourself, if you like) then click "save."
