#  Are there any plans in the future for new visualization tools?

Maybe, for example, side by side comparisons of data sets?

Our philosophy on the design on visualization tools is this: there will always
be more and better visualization designers and programmers on the web than
Pleiades can employ. Putting our stuff on the web with a variety of
representations (JSON, KML, Atom) makes it available to different
visualization platforms.

That said, we've got very specific needs for new visualizations that help
Pleiades users see data coverage, data quality, and that first and foremost
drive improvements of the data. Logged-in users currently see maps that cry
for help. We'd like these maps to cry out more clearly and effectively.
