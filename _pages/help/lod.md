#  Pleiades and Linked Open Data

Pleiades is a leading participant in the effort to create and sustain a
subgraph of linked open data about the ancient world.

See the following pages for complete information on linked data available from
Pleiades:

* [Linked Data for Pleiades Places](../Members/sgillies/news-items/linked-data-for-pleiades-places "Linked Data for Pleiades Places" )
* [Linked Data for Barrington Atlas Grids](../Members/sgillies/news-items/linked-data-for-barrington-atlas-grids "Linked Data for Barrington Atlas Grids" )

Or just jump directly to [our downloads page](../downloads) to get the whole
RDF dump as a single file.

Check out [our partner project Pelagios](../docs/using-our-data/pelagios),
which provides encoding guidance, a dataset browse interface, and a SPARQL
endpoint for web resources that use Pleiades identifiers to link their content
on the basis of shared geographical relevance.
