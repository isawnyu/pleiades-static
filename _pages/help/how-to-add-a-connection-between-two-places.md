#  How to add a connection between two places

"Connections" can be used to express relationships between two places in
Pleiades. It's easy to add a new connection.

Geographic relationships like overlap, containment, and continuity can be
expressed in Pleiades using "[connections](what-are-connections "What are
"connections?"" )." Adding a connection to a place resource is one of the
easiest and most helpful ways in which a community member can contribute to
the improvement of Pleiades content. Here's how to do it:

1. Log in
2. From the "Actions" menu in the grey UI bar under the View/Edit/Sharing/etc document tabs, select "Check out." This makes a working copy of the place that can be edited while the original remains available to the public and locked against other edits. By default, this draft working copy is invisible to the public, or other users, with the exception of system administrators.
3. Click the "Edit" document tab.
4. Within the "Default" tab on the editing form, click on the "add" button under the heading "Makes a connection with".
5. In the reference browser window, enter appropriate search terms to find the place to which you wish to make a connection. The "browse" link next to each line of the search results can be used to examine possible candidates.
6. Use the "insert" link next to the appropriate place title in the search results to make the connection.
7. Click the "close window" link.
8. Scroll to the bottom of the edit form and write a brief but useful "Change note."
9. Click "Save."

That's all there is to editing the working copy, but one final action is
needed to push these change along to the editors for review and publication.
Once you are satisfied with the connections you have made, select "Submit"
from the "State" menu in the grey UI bar to the left of "Actions." A reviewer
will in due course evaluate the changes, check that references are provided,
and either check the working copy in and update the published copy of the
place, or send it back for revision with notes that can be viewed in the
"History" document tab.
