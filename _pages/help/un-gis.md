#  Is Pleiades a GIS or WebGIS?

Although Pleiades employs GIS technology and methodology, it doesn't feature
the tool heavy map window onto stacks of thematic layers and thereby enabled
spatial analysis that is the hallmark of desktop or web GIS. The primacy of
space over concepts and names is another characteristic of GIS not found in
Pleiades, which also has to concern itself with uncertain or even fictitious
locations that are outside the scope of most GIS applications. Pleiades also
uses a distinctly web approach to making a gazetteer: ancient world resources
can evolve independently and explicitly interlink; there are no feature tables
and no table joins. Creating geographically aware web resources, not textbook
GIS, is the objective.
