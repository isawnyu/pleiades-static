title: Where did all the content in Pleiades come from?

#  Where did all the content in Pleiades come from?

The initial set of information (places, names) in Pleiades came from the
[Classical Atlas Project](http://www.unc.edu/depts/cl_atlas/). It was
converted from the compilation materials that were used to assemble the _Map-
by-Map Directory_ to the B_arrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World_.
We're grateful to the [American Philological
Association](http://www.apaclassics.org/), which sponsored the Classical Atlas
Project, for its collaboration in this regard.

Pleiades is designed to encourage users to improve, update and expand the
content. We're currently working with the [Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval
Civilization](http://darmc.harvard.edu/) (DARMC) at Harvard to collate our
content with their geodata sets, which are derived from a number of sources,
including the _Barrington Atlas_ map compilation materials. This will bring
coordinates into Pleiades, along with links to DARMC. For its part, DARMC will
get temporal information from us, and links back into Pleiades.

Meantime, individual Pleiades users have been adding new content too. For
example, consider this detailed treatment of the ancient settlement now called
[Ain el-Gedida](../places/861854258) in Egypt, prepared by [Nicola
Aravecchia](../author/naravecchia).
