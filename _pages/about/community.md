## A Community of Authors

_Pleiades_ content is updated collaboratively by volunteers around the world who work under the supervision of a volunteer Editorial College, filling a gap in the scholarly communications fabric for the typically small, highly technical notes and bits of geographic data that are otherwise unlikely to see the light of day in conventional, narrative-focused publications.  

Through _Pleiades_ these volunteers also provide authority control for ancient places. Just as the Library of Congress issues “authority files” to help improve discoverability in library catalogs by standardizing subject terms, names, and titles, _Pleiades_ assigns a stable identifying number to each place and to each record about a place. The use of numbers, rather than “standard” or “preferred” placenames, permits _Pleiades_ to itemize places that never had a formal name in antiquity (e.g., a particular courtyard, road segment, or bridge) or whose ancient name has been lost from our sources over the intervening centuries. The PIDs are incorporated into the page address in a uniform way that is easy to remember and to encode, thereby forming for each place a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a standard mechanism for identifying documents and objects on the world-wide web.  So, for example, _Pleiades_ assigns the PID 29573 to an ancient region known as “Gedrosia”. The URI for the _Pleiades_ page for this Gedrosia is http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/29573. This practice facilitates citation and linking for individual users and establishes a simple, permanent reference number for each place that can be used anywhere such references are valuable. 

## A Community of Collaborators

By establishing an authoritative gazetteer and associated open information services, _Pleiades_ has helped start a revolution: a constellation of online publications treating the histories, languages, texts, and artifacts of antiquity that make use of _Pleiades_ to contextualize their holdings interoperably across the Web. Operating under the aegis of the UK-based Pelagios Project, over 40 teams from 8 different countries have incorporated _Pleiades_ URIs into their datasets, thereby identifying places mentioned in texts and the origins and findspots of artifacts.  Several of these projects use _Pleiades_ data to provide their users with links, dynamic maps, and other services. All of them publish the pairwise matches between their own records and _Pleiades_ place records (over a million so far) as open data for other parties to use and other systems to harvest. 

_Pleiades_ uses this data too, creating lists of related content on every place page by comparing the URI for the place in question against the data published by Pelagios partners. For example, at the time of this writing the related content list on the _Pleiades_ page for Delphi in Greece included links to: 20 articles and images in the on-line Ancient History Encyclopedia, 29 coinage records from the American Numismatic Society, 121 archival excavation photographs in the databases of the German Archaeological Institute, 624 passages from ancient texts published in the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University, over 7,000 records for named historical persons born at Delphi from the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names at Oxford University, and more.
