## Significance and Impact

Pleiades has successfully demonstrated the practical value of combining web-enabled public participation with peer review and editorial oversight in order to update and refresh continually an important Humanities reference work. It has also refashioned the very definition of such works by extending the notion of “readership” to encompass innovative third-party digital applications that draw upon _Pleiades_ over the World-Wide Web for spatial data in immediately actionable forms and that depend upon it for geographic authority control across datasets. _Pleiades_ and its partners have created one of the first truly interoperating, cross-institutional online research environments for the Humanities. This track record has inspired others to re-imagine the role of geospatial information in digital humanities applications, to harness technologies like Linked Open Data (LOD) for expressing scholarly citation practices on the Web, and to look beyond narrow sustainability models focused on cost recovery.
