## History

The present project has its origins in the [Classical Atlas Project (CAP)](http://www.unc.edu/depts/cl-atlas), a 12-year effort that produced the _Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World_. In acknowledgement of this heritage, _Pleiades_ is named after the daughters of Atlas in Greek mythology.  CAP, which had received funding from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/) and other sources, redressed a critical gap in research tools for the Classics that had been identified in the early 1980s: historical cartography was so neglected as a subdiscipline of ancient studies that there existed no comprehensive, up-to-date scholarly reference atlas for Greek and Roman civilization.  

**early days, stoa, Ross**

An NEH Preservation and Access Research and Development grant (PA-51873-06, PI: Talbert) launched _Pleiades_ in Chapel Hill in 2006.  It culminated in 2008 having funded conceptual and experimental work to develop the data model now used, proving our hypothesis that off-the-shelf GIS data models were inadequate for the task and that a custom database was required.  

From 2008-2010, a JISC/NEH Transatlantic Digitization Collaboration Grant (PX-50003-08; PI Bagnall) with a team at King's College, London used the _Pleiades_ prototype to explore modes of cross-project geographic linking. Its findings, adapted to the more suitable Linked Open Data (LOD) model, formed the conceptual foundation for the Pelagios Project. 

From 2010 to 2014, _Pleiades_ moved into its implementation phase, supported by a combination of institutional funds and an NEH Preservation and Access Humanities Collections and Reference Resources grant (PW-50557-10, PI: Elliott). This grant facilitated the complete digitization of the _Barrington Atlas_ materials, incorporating work already done with separate funds by Prof. Michael McCormick and his students for Harvard's _Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilization_.
