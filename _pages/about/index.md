## A Gazetteer, and More

Like any good gazetteer, [_Pleiades_](http://pleiades.stoa.org) is an organized spatial reference work for use in research, publication, and teaching. Jointly operated by the [Institute for the Study of the Ancient World](http://isaw.nyu.edu) at New York University and by the [Ancient World Mapping Center](http://awmc.unc.edu) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, it constitutes the most accurate and comprehensive geographic dataset for the ancient Mediterranean world, identifying and describing nearly 35,000 places, spaces, territories, and regions.  It serves scholars, students, and members of the public alike as a ready reference and a guide to associated bibliography for places encountered in primary sources and secondary literature. 

As a database fronted by a web application, _Pleiades_ transcends the familiar structure of print gazetteers (alphabetical lists of placenames), to provide its users with multiple modes of discovery: thematic browsing, hyperlinks, and a search engine. _Pleiades_ publishes not just for individual human users, but also for search engines and for the burgeoning array of computational research and visualization tools that support work in fields like computational linguistics, digital text encoding, computational text analysis, natural language processing, named entity recognition, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

But it does so on an unprecedented scale, continuously enabling and drawing upon the work of individuals, groups, and their computational agents as the hub of a growing international scholarly communications network.
