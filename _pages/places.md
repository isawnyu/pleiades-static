# Places

_Pleiades_ is a gazetteer of ancient places. At present, it has extensive coverage for the Greek and Roman world, and is expanding into Ancient Near Eastern, Byzantine, Celtic, Early Islamic, and Early Medieval geography.

## Key Concepts 
{: #concepts }

Information about ancient places in _Pleiades_ is organized differently from both traditional gazetteers and standard GIS datasets. [In our view](/docs/papers-and-presentations/whats-an-un-gis), neither an alphabetical list of placesnames nor a set of thematic layers is sufficiently flexible and rigorous to represent a complex, partial, and changing understanding of ancient geography. Instead, _Pleiades_ content is organized into three types of "information resource": _places_, _locations_, and _names_. Although some other projects have adopted this pattern since we introduced it, it remains uncommon; consequently, all but the most casual user will want to familiarize themselves with the distinctions between, and relationships among, these resources by reading the [Pleiades Data Structure document](help/data-structure).

### [Advanced Search](/search_form) 
{: .btn .btn-lg .btn-primary .pleiades-btn-glossed }

[The Advanced Search page](/search_form) lets you construct more complex queries, but it can be much slower than the [Search](/search) page. See [Using Advanced Search](help/using-advanced-search) for tips.
