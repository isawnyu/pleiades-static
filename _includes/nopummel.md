## A Request:<br />Please don't pummel our site 

The _Pleiades_ website is presently undergoing [a major technical upgrade](https://github.com/isawnyu/pleiades-gazetteer#pleiades-3) to improve speed, performance, and reliability; however, at the present it remains vulnerable to excessively rapid and aggressively simultaneous usage. During this transitional period, we ask for your assistance in keeping the site stable and available to all.

### Humans

Please limit your browser interactions with the site to a single window or tab, especially when running advanced searches or waiting for slow pages (e.g., Athens, Rome) to load.

### Bots

Users of the [API](http://api.pleiades.stoa.org) should abide by the "crawl delay" and other directives in the [robots.txt file](/robots.txt). Please interpret a 500-series [HTTP status code](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) (particularly 503 or 504) as a request to refrain from additional HTTP requests for 15 minutes or more. Note that repeated violation of our [crawl-delay directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard#Crawl-delay_directive) may result in your bot being banned (403 for all requests). If you think your bot has been banned in error, please email [pleiades.admin@nyu.edu](mailto:pleiades.admin@nyu.edu?subject=Pleiades bot access issue) to start a conversation about the problem.
