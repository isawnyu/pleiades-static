Pleiades stores information about ancient and modern names of places in a
special "name resource". Here's how to add one.

If you know the name (either historical or modern) of an ancient place in
Pleiades, but see that it's not included in our dataset, you can easily add it
and submit it for review and eventual publication.

### Video: How to add a new name resource

[View this 3-minute video on how to add a new name
resource](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrkFWaZKtdk). Be sure to review the
"Criteria" section, below, before you start adding new names.

### Step-by-step: How to add a new name resource

  1. Navigate to the place resource and check it to make sure that the name is not already documented.
  2. Click the "Add Name" button.
  3. Fill in the appropriate fields on the various tabs (see "Criteria", below).
  4. Click "Save".
  5. Review the information and make any additional changes and additions you think are warranted.
  6. When you are satisfied with the results, select "State: Drafting" and change it to "Submit for Review".

### Criteria for name resources

At a minimum, the following fields must be completed before submitting your
suggestion for review:

  * On the "Default" tab:
    * _Romanized name:_ a comma-separated list of transliterations into Roman characters of the name you're adding. If you're adding an English or Latin name, this string will exactly match the name in the original language and script. For names occuring in non-Roman scripts, you can use any transliteration scheme(s) you think appropriate.
    * _Level of uncertainty:_ if you are completely sure this name is to be connected with the geographic location(s) already associated with the place resource, then choose "certain." "Less certain" and "uncertain" are appropriate values if there is some debate or question surrounding the association of an ancient name with a particular location. If you use "less certain" or "uncertain", you should add an explanation in the "description" field and cite any relevant sources using the "References" tab.
    * _Temporal attestations:_ indicate the time period(s) during which this name is thought to have been applicable to the place in question. If it's a modern name, choose "Modern".
  * On the "Transcription" tab:
    * _Language_: you must indicate the language and script of the name.
  * On the "References" tab:
    * You must provide at least one _Reference_ of type="Cites as evidence" to indicate a witness for the name you're adding. If it's a modern name, any widely used public resource (e.g., Wikipedia) is acceptable. For an ancient name, you must include at least one ancient source unless the name form is reconstructed. If reconstructed, then you should cite (type="Cites") the modern scholarly literature in which the argument is made. If you are arguing for an original interpretation, then provide any relevant citations of primary or secondary literature here and explain your rationale on the "Details" tab. See our [Citation Guide](citation-guide "Citation Guide" ) for information on how to format references. 

Whenever possible, please also give us the following additional information on
the "Transcription" tab:

  * _Name as attested:_ enter the Unicode (UTF-8) transcription of the name as it appears in the witness you're citing. If at all possible, please normalize to the nominative case. If the writing system in question does not yet appear in the Unicode standard, you should leave this field blank and put an appropriate transliteration in the "Romanized name" field on the "Default" tab.
  * _Accuracy of transcription:_ indicate your assessment of the accuracy of the witness(es) you're citing in transmitting the name correctly.
  * _Level of transcription completeness:_ indicate the condition of the witness as it affects the reading of the name.
