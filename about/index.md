## A Gazetteer, and More

Like any good gazetteer, [_Pleiades_](http://pleiades.stoa.org) is an organized spatial reference work for use in research, publication, and teaching. Jointly operated by the [Institute for the Study of the Ancient World](http://isaw.nyu.edu) at New York University and by the [Ancient World Mapping Center](http://awmc.unc.edu) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, it constitutes the most accurate and comprehensive geographic dataset for the ancient Mediterranean world, identifying and describing nearly 35,000 places, spaces, territories, and regions.  It serves scholars, students, and members of the public alike as a ready reference and a guide to associated bibliography for places encountered in primary sources and secondary literature. 

As a database fronted by a web application, _Pleiades_ transcends the familiar structure of print gazetteers (alphabetical lists of placenames), to provide its users with multiple modes of discovery: thematic browsing, hyperlinks, and a search engine. _Pleiades_ publishes not just for individual human users, but also for search engines and for the burgeoning array of computational research and visualization tools that support work in fields like computational linguistics, digital text encoding, computational text analysis, natural language processing, named entity recognition, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

But it does so on an unprecedented scale, continuously enabling and drawing upon the work of individuals, groups, and their computational agents as the hub of a growing international scholarly communications network.

## A Community of Authors

_Pleiades_ content is updated collaboratively by volunteers around the world who work under the supervision of a volunteer Editorial College, filling a gap in the scholarly communications fabric for the typically small, highly technical notes and bits of geographic data that are otherwise unlikely to see the light of day in conventional, narrative-focused publications.  

Through _Pleiades_ these volunteers also provide authority control for ancient places. Just as the Library of Congress issues “authority files” to help improve discoverability in library catalogs by standardizing subject terms, names, and titles, _Pleiades_ assigns a stable identifying number to each place and to each record about a place. The use of numbers, rather than “standard” or “preferred” placenames, permits _Pleiades_ to itemize places that never had a formal name in antiquity (e.g., a particular courtyard, road segment, or bridge) or whose ancient name has been lost from our sources over the intervening centuries. The PIDs are incorporated into the page address in a uniform way that is easy to remember and to encode, thereby forming for each place a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a standard mechanism for identifying documents and objects on the world-wide web.  So, for example, _Pleiades_ assigns the PID 29573 to an ancient region known as “Gedrosia”. The URI for the _Pleiades_ page for this Gedrosia is http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/29573. This practice facilitates citation and linking for individual users and establishes a simple, permanent reference number for each place that can be used anywhere such references are valuable. 

## A Community of Collaborators

By establishing an authoritative gazetteer and associated open information services, _Pleiades_ has helped start a revolution: a constellation of online publications treating the histories, languages, texts, and artifacts of antiquity that make use of _Pleiades_ to contextualize their holdings interoperably across the Web. Operating under the aegis of the UK-based Pelagios Project, over 40 teams from 8 different countries have incorporated _Pleiades_ URIs into their datasets, thereby identifying places mentioned in texts and the origins and findspots of artifacts.  Several of these projects use _Pleiades_ data to provide their users with links, dynamic maps, and other services. All of them publish the pairwise matches between their own records and _Pleiades_ place records (over a million so far) as open data for other parties to use and other systems to harvest. 

_Pleiades_ uses this data too, creating lists of related content on every place page by comparing the URI for the place in question against the data published by Pelagios partners. For example, at the time of this writing the related content list on the _Pleiades_ page for Delphi in Greece included links to: 20 articles and images in the on-line Ancient History Encyclopedia, 29 coinage records from the American Numismatic Society, 121 archival excavation photographs in the databases of the German Archaeological Institute, 624 passages from ancient texts published in the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University, over 7,000 records for named historical persons born at Delphi from the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names at Oxford University, and more.  

## History

The present project has its origins in the [Classical Atlas Project (CAP)](http://www.unc.edu/depts/cl-atlas), a 12-year effort that produced the _Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World_. In acknowledgement of this heritage, _Pleiades_ is named after the daughters of Atlas in Greek mythology.  CAP, which had received funding from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/) and other sources, redressed a critical gap in research tools for the Classics that had been identified in the early 1980s: historical cartography was so neglected as a subdiscipline of ancient studies that there existed no comprehensive, up-to-date scholarly reference atlas for Greek and Roman civilization.

An NEH Preservation and Access Research and Development grant (PA-51873-06, PI: Talbert) launched _Pleiades_ in Chapel Hill in 2006.  It culminated in 2008 having funded conceptual and experimental work to develop the data model now used, proving our hypothesis that off-the-shelf GIS data models were inadequate for the task and that a custom database was required.  

From 2008-2010, a JISC/NEH Transatlantic Digitization Collaboration Grant (PX-50003-08; PI Bagnall) with a team at King's College, London used the _Pleiades_ prototype to explore modes of cross-project geographic linking. Its findings, adapted to the more suitable Linked Open Data (LOD) model, formed the conceptual foundation for the Pelagios Project. 

From 2010 to 2014, _Pleiades_ moved into its implementation phase, supported by a combination of institutional funds and an NEH Preservation and Access Humanities Collections and Reference Resources grant (PW-50557-10, PI: Elliott). This grant facilitated the complete digitization of the _Barrington Atlas_ materials, incorporating work already done with separate funds by Prof. Michael McCormick and his students for Harvard's _Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilization_.

## Significance and Impact

Pleiades has successfully demonstrated the practical value of combining web-enabled public participation with peer review and editorial oversight in order to update and refresh continually an important Humanities reference work. It has also refashioned the very definition of such works by extending the notion of “readership” to encompass innovative third-party digital applications that draw upon _Pleiades_ over the World-Wide Web for spatial data in immediately actionable forms and that depend upon it for geographic authority control across datasets. _Pleiades_ and its partners have created one of the first truly interoperating, cross-institutional online research environments for the Humanities. This track record has inspired others to re-imagine the role of geospatial information in digital humanities applications, to harness technologies like Linked Open Data (LOD) for expressing scholarly citation practices on the Web, and to look beyond narrow sustainability models focused on cost recovery.
